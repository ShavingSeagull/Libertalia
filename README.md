# Libertalia
###### Last updated: Sep 7th 2018

## Overview

Libertalia is a text and 2D sprite pirate themed game revolving around trade and, obviously, piracy. Libertalia 
is the utopian colony said to have been founded by Henry Avery during the height of the pirate age. Nobody is 
sure if Libertalia ever actually existed, but knowing that other pirates of the day ended up founding their own
colonies and cities, it certainly isn't a stretch of the imagination to think that Libertalia might have
been true.

## Features

### Planned Features
Libertalia is still in early production, but the features planned will include:

- Trading with the different ports of the Caribbean. Each port will have its own supply and demand structure,
which will affect the prices they offer
- Random events. Sailing from port to port would be an easy way to make money. Too easy. Random events will
ensure that the next trip from Port Royal to Nassau won't be a walk in the park
- Combat. This wouldn't be a pirate game without combat! Combat can take place as a result of your decision
to chase down that pesky French sloop, or as a result of a French galleon getting its own back by ambushing
you on your next trip to Tortuga

### Possible Features
A lot of things can change during production. While the above are confirmed features of Libertalia, below
are the features that are favoured to be in the final release, though not guaranteed at this early stage:

- Base building (text and 2D sprite based)
- Main character creation and development (rather than just naming a ship)
- Growing your fleet to include multiple ships
- Watch this space. This list will undoubtedly grow

## The Tech

Libertalia is written entirely in Python 3, using the [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org) library. So far, no
other libraries have been utilised. I use [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) to modify the images, mostly for the
purpose of colouring them to alpha.

## License

I'm not intending to issue an open-source license, as I'm planning to work on this alone and keep it as much 
under my control as possible.
